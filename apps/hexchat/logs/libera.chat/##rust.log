Nov 25 01:59:29 <rendar>	i have reduced all my life's problems to one single Rust error: async fn run<T>(&self mut, listener: T) { tokio::select!( listener.accept() -> type T hasn't any accept() function, now.. what is the best way to proceed here? can i tell rust with a 'where' that T could be only TcpListener or UnixListener (which both implements accept()) or in such cases I must only passes traits?
Nov 25 01:59:59 <j`ey>	only traits
Nov 25 02:00:20 <rendar>	fine
Nov 25 02:01:54 <rendar>	the thing, i'm finding a little bit of difficult navigating rust docs, if i try to find 'accept' in here https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.22/tokio/net/struct.TcpListener.html?search=accept -- i get only `poll_accept[_std]`
